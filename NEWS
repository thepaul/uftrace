uftrace v0.7
============
* dynamic tracing support (x86_64 only)
  enable tracing for selected functions with -P option
  it needs some compiler support though
  - gcc with -mnop-mcount option
  - clang (X-ray) with -fxray-instrument option

* AArch64 support
  add preliminary support for ARM v8 (64-bit)
  first integer argument is missing

* kernel tracing change
  show recorded kernel functions by default
  partial support for event tracing
  fix to send/receive kernel data via network
  filter out sys_clock_gettime() for non-VDSO systems

* dump change:
  show arguments and return values properly
  show more kernel tracing info
  fix file offset printing

* build change:
  fix various problems on GCC 7
  update configure script for better distro packaging

And many bug fixes and improvements.  Thanks for all contributors:
  Dridi Boukelmoune, Honggyu Kim, Taeung Song, Wonseok Ko


uftrace v0.6.2

* kernel tracing update:
  save kernel metadata so that it can be viewed from a different machine
  adjust tracer settings to reduce lost kernel data

  The --kernel-only option was added

* replay change:
  add --output-fields option to customize the info on the left side
  currently time, delta, elapsed, duration, tid and addr fields are supported

* filter change:
  apply time filter on replay
  add --time-range option to limit data analysis
  report, graph and dump honors same filter on replay
  add 'time' trigger to set a different threshold on specific functions

* flame-graph support:
  "uftrace dump --flame-graph" creates a SVG file
  use --sample-time option to control sampling frequency in the output

* build change:
  improve build process to facilitate distro packaging
  configure script checks dependency and shows warning
